Q: Explain why you can't create a new account or arbitrarily update
account balances (or show that you can).
You can't create a new account because the code uses the sql statements only as queries,
being passed into a query function that shouldn't be able to update or add anything.
Also, creating a new account would require more knowledge of the database and how 
it is structured, like how the passwords are encrypted and such.
