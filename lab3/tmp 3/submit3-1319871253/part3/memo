1. The security flaw in the FCCU application was that it did not check the inputs that the user put
into the fields. This allowed them to modify the SQL statements and essentially access anything
from the database that they wanted. 

The way I fixed the flaw was pretty simple:
I made sure that all the inputs from the id and password (and everything that required database
lookup) to make sure that they didn't include potentially dangerous code. Things like this include
making sure the input for ID's and numbers were actually integers, and couldn't be anything else.
The other thing was disallowing characters like the ' (apostrophe), which allowed me really access
anything I wanted. 

A recovery plan for the server:
1. The breach was pretty serious because this involves very important information (and money). 
A hacker being able to access these things allowed him to steal $ and even SSN's. The attacker
can gain root access because php allows that to happen. If the hacker injected his own code in it,
he would have been able to do practically anything.

2. In order to secure the system, we would have to make sure that all the potential injections are
impossible, and it would be good to check if anything has been affected by the breach (if one occured).
It would be smart to try to restore the alterations, but also make sure that there's always checking
for correct input values.

3. When I first tried to do the SQL injection, it didn't seem to work.. I'm not sure why not, but I typed it 
in again and it worked fine. Sometimes the sql quieries seemed to act in weird ways so I failed at first,
but I think I was able to do what I needed to do.
